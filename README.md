# Motion Detector

## Project Overview
This Python project, "Motion Detector," is designed to detect and track motion using a camera feed. Ideal for security, surveillance, or interactive projects, it leverages computer vision techniques to identify moving objects in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-Time Motion Detection**: Detects moving objects in the camera's field of view.
- **Adjustable Sensitivity**: Allows customization of motion sensitivity to suit different environments.
- **Logging and Alerts**: Option to log motion events and trigger alerts.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on various operating systems with camera support.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd motion_detector
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Here's how to use the Motion Detector:
1. Run the script from the command line or through a Python IDE.
2. Adjust the settings as per your requirements, like sensitivity and logging options.
3. The script will start processing the live camera feed and detect any motion.

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV for real-time image processing
- (Any other libraries used in the script)
